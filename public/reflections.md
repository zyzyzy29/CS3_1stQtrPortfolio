# Zy's Reflections 

###### I <3 Stitch hehe

I Love Stitch hehe

### List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.
1. **Variable Declaration** - When you use var, you can declare anywhere. It will consider the last declared value. Let variables can't be redeclared in the same sub block of code but you can redeclare in another block. Const variables can't ever be redeclared. Hence, why its called const (meaning constant). 
2. **Arithmetic Operators** - It was easy to understand these since it was mostly basic symbols like + for add and * for multiplication. It's also similar to the coding language we learned in grade 8. The only thing I had to really study is the difference when you add numerical values and when you add both a numerical AND a STRING value. For numerical, it would 5 + 5 = 10. However, for string and numerical, it would be hi + 5 = hi5.
3. **Comparison Operators** - I was able to master this since I related it to math lessons. >=, <=, == and != are all terms used in math but in different way of writing it down. The main thing i studied was that === meant STRICTLY equal and == was equal. 
4. **Switch Statements** - This is what you use when there are way too much layers of if else if codes. Its a way of making the code look more organized and easier to understand. Its similar to if else. It gives cases and what would happen during that case. If the case is followed then it would not be checked for any of the following cases due to the BREAK statement. 
5. **If-else Statements** - This was pretty similar to exercises I did in Ma'am Edlen's class. It was pretty easy to understand since it just meant if this doesn't happen whats the next possible outcome or if this happens, whats the outcome. It's a "do this or else" situation. 


### List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why. The why should be per topic listed
1. **Logical Operators** - Being honest, I still take a while to understand what the output will be for the && ||. I got confused when we started mentioning non boolean and boolean. I know how it works but I get confused and overthink the question.
2. **For Loops** - I need more practice in for loops because I keep confusing it with the other loops. They are similar to c++ which is why I don't completely not understand. 
3. **While Loops** - This actually has same reason as For loops. I know how it works but I get conused when to use each loop.
4. **do while loops** - hehe.. Sir same reason as the previous 2. I know how to get the output of loops but knowing what to use in different situations is another story.
5. **Generating output** - I know how to use console.log , alert (), document. write but I get confused about the one with the id and innerHTML. I don't understand why we use it and how to use it so I need more practice for it .

### **Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items**.
I learn better by seeing other people do it. I plan on asking my friends who understand the topic well to explain it to me and show me how they do it. 

### **In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?**
I don't think any of our activities were ineffective since I was able to teach myself step by step through the activities. However, I found the multiple attempt quiz 1 and 2 really helpful. I may not have gotten perfect right away but the process of figuring out my mistakes really helped me better understand the lessons.
